<p>Hey There ! I'm Sébastien a {% include age.html %} years old french computer science student. I like to code in C, Python and Lua to make a lot of projects/tools that are fun and interseting or that can be useful.</p>

<p>I've been using linux for over a year now, first because i was told it was better and now by passion and because i find it better ! I'm currently running Arch linux with Hyprland and code using Neovim, you can find my dotfiles <a href="//github.com/DoussangSebastien/dotfiles" target="_blank">here</a>, i've made them over time and are probably half homemade and half stolen based on what i liked.</p>

<p>Beside programming i also love to go on hikes, climbing, video games and spending time with my cats</p>

<p>You can find some of my favourite project here:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="//github.com/DoussangSebastien/42sh" target="_blank">42sh</a> A small shell inspired by tcsh</li>
    <li><a href="//github.com/DoussangSebastien/Corewar" target="_blank">Corewar</a> Our version of the famous coreware</li>
    <li><a href="//github.com/DoussangSebastien/clipThat" target="_blank">clipThat</a> A basic clipboard manager for nvim</li>
</ul>
