### My first article about and on this website !

At first the idea of making my own personnal website/blog was in a big list of project i wanted to do because i always found it interesting to make my own basic page from nothing. At first i didn't wanted to do it because i prefered to focus on my studies but since i was at the end of my internship i knew i would have the time to do it, so after talking about it with another intern and knwing i would have the time i started this project!

I was totally new to all that, the only thing i knew was basic html and how i could host it for free, being github pages. Knowing github pages could only host static pages and that i wanted to build something that would be easy to maintain/change i chose to use jekyll to build y website.
That way changing the header or the way my website should look would be easy.
Also since i wanted a blog and since i really like markdown, jekyll allowed my to write everything in markdown which gives me a lot of options for my posts !

As for langage even if i'm french i prefer to write everything in english so that a majority of people can read it and to chalenge myself in becoming better in english, but adding a french translation option is still an idea i have and will probably do if i get motivated enough to translate everything back in french.

As for the style of this website i didn't have any idea until one night after starting to make this website, i played warframe, more specifically the 1999 content which makes you use an old computer interface that i copied for this website, that way my wallpaper, windows and directory on main page are the same from warframe pom2!

Since i plan on writing articles on what i'm doing from time to time i thought it would be logic to make the first one about this website, and now that i feel a bit confident in the look of my website it's the perfect time to write and publish it. And even if it's not 100% done i find it great to have my own page that i made and where i can make everything look how i want and talk about stuff.

In case you interested, you can find the whole code on my github (you can find it in the contact section) and you can also leave a small message in the guestbook.
